# CarPricePredictionRegressionModels
Developing a Machine Learning Model for Price Prediction in Cars Through the Evaluation of Various Regression Approaches (Including Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression)

Upon comparing these three models, the analysis leads to the determination that the Multiple Linear Regression model stands out as the most effective option for predicting car prices from the dataset. This finding aligns with the observation that there are a total of 27 variables, and it becomes apparent that multiple variables among them have the potential to impact the final car price.
